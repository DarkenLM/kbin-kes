# Description

This tool is not ready for mainstream consumption yet.

kbin Enhancement Suite (KES) bundles together many userscripts that add various features to kbin and adds an integrated interface for configuring them.

As such, KES is three things:

- A curated and audited collection of modifications (userscripts)
- A menu for managing this collection of modifications
- A framework for authors to add new modifications
